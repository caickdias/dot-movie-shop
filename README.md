# Movies shop

A test assignment where I had to create this virtual movie shop.

# Getting started

## Dependencies

```
React 18.2.0
```

## Installing

Once you have everything installed and running, let's clone this repository and open its folder. No change to any files should be required.

```
git clone https://github.com/caickdias/dot-movies-shop.git
cd dot-movies-shop
```
Then run npm install to install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you get your [private API for TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY='YOUR API KEY'
```

Then, just run:

```
npm start
```
